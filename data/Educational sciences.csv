Participants were 14 students enrolled in a graduate course on advanced instructional design. The case was presented to students using two hypermedia structures, hierarchical (tree-like structure) and heterarchical (network-like structure). Results from analyses of four data sources revealed that problem solutions developed in response to the heterarchical case design were more cogent and convincing than problem solutions developed in response to the hierarchical case design. Specifically, the heterarchical case solutions provided evidence of a heuristic problem-solving process facilitating the identification of an expert-like solution to the case and the articulation of learners' understanding and application of grounded and engaging instructional designs.","Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research",not explicitly computational,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1,0.2345596426413221,0.8902342294431473,-0.5396509170532227,0.6430904865264893,Computational,Computational

The assumption is that unimportant information ought to be weakened and attenuated in speech. Consequently, given information is often deaccented and new information is usually, accented in most, varieties of English. However, some nonnative varieties, such as Singapore English (SE) appear not to deaccent given information. The present article seeks to investigate the apparent absence of deaccenting in SE by attempting a cross-varietal comparison with British English (BE). The data comprise three main categories of given information: repeated lexical items, anaphoric reference, and sentences that Cue deaccenting by inference. Results indicate that SE speakers showed no acoustic evidence of prosodically attenuating given information unlike their BE counterparts and that in the informational domain, SE does not appear to have a comparable prosodic means of signaling ne v and given information.
