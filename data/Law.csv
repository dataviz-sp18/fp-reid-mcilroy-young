Courts and legislatures have struggled to find a balance between encouraging innovation in software development and avoiding undesirable digital information monopolies. Although neither the patent nor the copyright system has provided a particularly satisfactory paradigm for software protection, copyright arguably creates more insidious undercurrents in today's marketplace. If lawmakers do not act expeditiously to stem the tide of copyright protection, the software industry could be facing an intellectual property grab of great proportions which might ultimately impede innovations in software development. This Article argues for a shifting of the paradigms employed for software protection. In particular, copyright law should be scaled back and, to the extent it is retained, the doctrines of merger and scenes a faire should be more clearly developed to avoid unjustifiable information monopolies and questionable market practices. Lawmakers also need to recognize that, due to recent advances in encryption technology, trade secrecy is now a more viable candidate for software protection than in the past.",Law,not explicitly computational,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9985286002623808,0.038153051030614116,3.291346549987793,-3.228722095489502,Computational,Not Computational

Currently, some thirty million people regularly play such games and the number is growing. Exploring the reach of the Tax Code into virtual world transactions not only responds to the potentially practical needs of millions of U.S. taxpayers, it also permits a re-evaluation of core principles of income tax as they interplay with life activities in the context of twenty-first century American culture. This Article's central thesis is that while player activity in virtual worlds undoubtedly produces measurable economic value to the player, player activity that occurs solely within the online virtual world is not gross income under the law. The Article argues for a ""cash out"" rule. Players whose added wealth consists solely in ""units of play"" should not be taxed unless and until they convert those units into cash or property that is something other than a unit of play. Conversely, when the play ceases, taxation begins. The resulting line-drawing difficulties have nothing to do with player intent nor with ""fun"" and ""games."" Instead, the issue presented is as old as the Tax Code itself: at what point does economic gain become legal gain?

Specifically, the author analyzes the meanings of ""ordinarily maintained"" and ""reasonably usable"" as used in Rule 34(b). After laying out the background of electronic discovery under the Federal Rules, the author interprets the rule's requirements for default production. First, the author analyzes the rule's language to determine its plain meaning. Then, the author examines the rule's position in the overall scheme of the Federal Rules. Finally, the author examines the rule's drafting history to determine the intent of the drafters. The Note concludes that despite the apparent clarity of the rule's language, the rule is ambiguous by stating that parties have a choice between ""ordinarily maintained"" format and ""reasonably usable"" format. In fact, Rule 34(h) requires the production of information in an objectively reasonably accessible format. In effect, ""reasonably usable"" form is not simply a permitted alternative it is the required default form of production.

The matching process, common to almost all forensic sciences, is assessed in the forensic and scientific contexts. Particular emphasis is recommended to differentiate between the processes of interpretation and evaluation. 'Interpretation' is proposed to be the results of the analytical process with no case-dependent conclusions. 'Evaluation' is defined as the significance of the interpretation within the context of the case. Specific difficulties in the analysis of DNA, believed by some to be the gold standard in scientific forensic individualization, are used to illustrate the proposed definitions of analysis, interpretation and evaluation and the particular problems with DNA profiling in the forensic context.

In essence, hotspot mapping is used as a basic form of crime prediction, relying on retrospective data to identify the areas of high concentrations of crime and where policing and other crime reduction resources should be deployed. A number of different mapping techniques are used for identifying hotspots of crime-point mapping, thematic mapping of geographic areas (e. g. Census areas), spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping and kernel density estimation (KDE). Several research studies have discussed the use of these methods for identifying hotspots of crime, usually based on their ease of use and ability to spatially interpret the location, size, shape and orientation of clusters of crime incidents. Yet surprising, very little research has compared how hotspot mapping techniques can accurately predict where crimes will occur in the future. This research uses crime data for a period before a fixed date (that has already passed) to generate hotspot maps, and test their accuracy for predicting where crimes will occur next. Hotspot mapping accuracy is compared in relation to the mapping technique that is used to identify concentrations of crime events (thematic mapping of Census Output Areas, spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping, and KDE) and by crime type-four crime types are compared (burglary, street crime, theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles). The results from this research indicate that crime hotspot mapping prediction abilities differ between the different techniques and differ by crime type. KDE was the technique that consistently outperformed the others, while street crime hotspot maps were consistently better at predicting where future street crime would occur when compared to results for the hotspot maps of different crime types. The research offers the opportunity to benchmark comparative research of other techniques and other crime types, including comparisons between advanced spatial analysis techniques and prediction mapping methods. Understanding how hotspot mapping can predict spatial patterns of crime and how different mapping methods compare will help to better inform their application in practice.
