Zeno paradoxes are a good example of their use in antiquity, while in modern science theoretical physics stands as a domain where paradoxes are intensively used. This is not the case with cities and their planning, however. This article introduces paradoxes as useful means to study predictions in the context of cities and their planning. It discusses several city planning paradoxes and suggests seeing their origin in the complexity of cities and in the role played by cognitive maps and information exchange in complex, self-organizing cities.","Planning & Development,Public Administration",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,1,0.14138780008429788,0.9470978948721108,-0.8751003742218018,0.9287105202674866,Computational,Computational

We find that France not only followed the technological lead of the United States in information technology but also emulated some of its more business-oriented approaches in the implementation of the Internet, despite its own longstanding tradition of government intervention in industrial and commercial matters. This policy shift appears to be spurred by the global economy. Traditionally state-controlled national economies are now increasingly leveraging private interests for successful industrial policy. When applying Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith's advocacy coalition framework to the American and French diffusion of the Internet, we find policy communities actually expanding to private and public actors, including industry captains, legislators, and civil servants. These subsystems work together through classic lawmaking and lobbying under technological and economic constraints.","Political Science,Public Administration",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0.999953402386098,0.007514469724790233,5.0904860496521,-4.883428573608398,Computational,Not Computational

Adapting these measures for the British government is problematic due to the whipped nature of parliamentary divisions and the small number of free votes. Early Day Motions (EDMs) provide Members of Parliament in the UK with the freedom to express organised opinion without undue pressure from government whips. This article proposes using the signing of these motions to gauge cohesiveness of political parties, and illustrates the link between EDMs and political events during the recent 2005/2006 parliamentary session. This article further uses the cohesion of EDM signatories to identify issues that cause political parties to unite or divide in opinion. Classifying EDMs from the 2001-2005 parliament into different types, a weighted cohesion measure is used to identify which EDMs cause maximal and minimal cohesion.

One manifestation of this attitude in state government today is the effort to maintain part-time ""citizen"" legislatures, whether through term limits, low salaries, or session length restrictions. But, realistically, how part-time is the job of a state legislator? We discuss findings from a national survey of state legislators in which they report spending more time on the job than one might anticipate given the presumably part-time, nature of many state legislatures. As expected, we find that legislators serving in bodies characterized as full-time, professional legislatures spend more time on the job than those in part-time institutions, but we also see significant variation across states in both groups. We also find considerable variation among individual legislators, which is related to factors such as holding a leadership position and a legislator's demographic characteristics. We also show how time on the job is allocated among specific components of representation.",Political Science,not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0.9993751263534584,0.02746192582422476,3.8096022605896,-3.567733764648437,Not Computational,Not Computational

An expected-utility analysis of the decision to run for office indicates that term limits reduce the benefits of seeking re-election, even for state legislators who are eligible to run, and reduce the opportunity cost of running for other offices. From this analysis, I develop a series of hypotheses about the probability that state legislators-term-limited or not-will seek re-election or other offices under a term limits regime, the value of the offices they seek, and the probability with which they will win these contests. I test these hypotheses using data on the career choices of state legislators in states with and without term limits in 2000-02.

We explore this and other questions about three relationships (influence, friendship, and policy consultation) with a longitudinal study of the Michigan House of Representatives, a highly professionalized body with stringent limits on legislative terms. We found that term limits lead to a more pronounced regional component of friendship, greater concentration of influence among caucus leaders, consulting networks with more prominent hubs that could control the flow of information, and a decline in relationships across party lines.
