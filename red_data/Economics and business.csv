Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland have developed the ""Global Supply Chain Game"" (GSCG). A specific instance of the game is called the ""Distributor Game,"" centered on globalization and the real-time supply chain. The GSCG differs from many existing business learning games in that, as opposed to being turn-based and locked in on demonstrating a single phenomenon (i.e., the bullwhip effect), it simulates a real-world experience by operating on a continuous clock with ongoing events and responses to individual decisions. The decision-making processes of the distributors in the game are controlled by human players. To confront the human players with a complex and dynamic environment, suppliers, markets, and competing distribution centers are represented by computer-controlled actors. The Distributor Game has been tested at the Robert H. Smith School of Business in seven courses since January 2005. The beta-tests include four MBA classes, two Executive MBA classes, and a single undergraduate class. Each class has been consistent in its approval of the game as a tool in simulating the complexities of a global supply chain and facilitating learning about how to successfully manage this environment.",Transportation,not explicitly computational,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,1.0,0.5196538624299681,0.6532744468331029,0.05752741172909736,-0.021128565073013302,Computational,Computational

The U.S. and multilateral regulators responded by implementing security requirements that focus on the maritime industry. It is difficult to quantify the economic impacts of these regulations as maritime shipping firms have been either reluctant to share their data for proprietary and security reasons or have not been able to quantify costs. This article reports on how firms involved in U.S. waterborne container trade have responded to the new maritime container security initiatives. Senior container line executives, port officials, and marine terminal security officers were interviewed. It is concluded that the biggest benefit of the new security requirements is that they have fostered a cooperative security relationship between industry and government.

The methodology used was an open-ended panel interview conducted during two site visits. The first was to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard's Inactive Ships facility in Bremerton, Washington to inspect the decommissioned USS Constellation aircraft carrier. This panel primarily focused on the generation of size and cost data. The second visit was to Goose Creek, South Carolina for a panel interview with DynCorp contractors responsible for the exercise and care of afloat stocks. This panel focused on the ability of the ship's elevators and top deck to increase readiness by enabling the use of more rigorous land-based maintenance and exercising criteria. The study concludes that reactivation cost estimates are far below those previously espoused by similar research efforts.

The international logistics zones in Hong Kong and Kaohsiung ports have advantages in infrastructure, political, and financial related investment criteria.

What has been written about M&As in the maritime transport sector has focused on the most high-profile of these, and on consolidations within sub-sectors of the industry. Using a database of all M&As globally, and extracting the cases involving companies coded as being in the maritime transport sector, this article examines the overall pattern of maritime transport-related M&As on a global scale from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2000. It addresses the motivations for these M&As and finds that 40 percent of the M&As were cross-border deals. A substantial number of all cases were either financial restructurings or acquisitions of assets (36 percent). The article examines a sample of the remaining 64 percent of cases on a case-by-case basis and concludes that the industry, while going through a period of consolidation, is also embarking on alternate patterns of growth, particularly strategic and synergist expansion.
