In this paper we evaluate different metrics for computing reputation in multi-agent systems. We present a formal model for describing metrics in reputation systems and show how different well-known global reputation metrics are expressed by it. Based on the model a generic simulation framework for reputation metrics was implemented. We used our simulation framework to compare different global reputation systems to find their strengths and weaknesses. The strength of a metric is measured by its resistance against different threat-models, i.e. different types of hostile agents. Based on our results we propose a new metric for reputation systems.","Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,1,0.04689291752773316,0.9891131238548294,-1.5624985694885254,1.44936203956604,Computational,Computational

In this paper we use multi agent simulation to study several organisation types in which task rotation may or may not emerge. By looking at the development of expertise and motivation of the different agents and their performance as a function of self-organisation, boredom, and task rotation frequency, we describe the dynamics of task rotation. The results show that systems in which task rotation emerges perform better than systems in which the agents merely specialise in one skill. Furthermore, we found that under certain circumstances, a task that leads to a high degree of boredom was performed better than a task causing a low level of boredom.","Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,1,0.5166354954264029,0.638053932382683,-0.026923542842268944,-0.09349009394645692,Computational,Computational

These collective models are partly validated through Individual Activities Surveys focusing on behavioural patterns of individual islanders. Then, these models are merged into a single conceptual one using qualitative analysis software.

Here we distinguish between three aspects of uncertainty. Environmental uncertainty is the variance of resources in the environment, perceived uncertainty is the variance of the resource distribution as perceived by the organism and effective uncertainty is the variance of resources effectively enjoyed by individuals. We show analytically that perceived uncertainty is larger than environmental uncertainty and that effective uncertainty is smaller than perceived uncertainty, when cooperation is present. We use an agent society simulation in a two dimensional world for the generation of simulation data as one realisation of the analytical results. Together with our earlier theoretical work, results here show that cooperation can buffer the detrimental effects of uncertainty on the organism. The proposed conceptualisation of uncertainty can help in understanding its effects on social evolution and in designing artificial social environments.","Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,1,0.049463116313708665,0.988309786617682,-1.5250835418701172,1.4307161569595337,Computational,Computational

For those who have engaged in and/or read about action research, the questions addressed in this article are familiar: How can we maintain respectful relations between us? How can we ensure the project respects local knowledge? How can we ensure the ownership of the new knowledge created by the project remains with the collective? How can we balance the power dynamics between ourselves, and between the organizations involved? What the article offers, is a dialogical reflection on how these challenges are being met within this particular project. It examines the development of a common set of values and beliefs that emerge as the researchers attempt to engage within the 'ethical space' (Ermine, 2005) necessary for the development of a respectful collaboration. The article explores and develops a series of questions for researchers to consider as they struggle to find common ground where such an exchange, crossing cultural and power divides, can occur.","Management,Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",not explicitly computational,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0.9480875650699092,0.19278782805215036,1.419583797454834,-1.4853047132492063,Not Computational,Not Computational
