First, we want to verify the effects of different frequencies of KR, self-controlled by the subjects, through the comparison of the extremes: that is, comparison between the highest and lowest frequencies of KR. Second, we want to compare subjects that ask for more KR in the initial part of the acquisition phase with subjects that ask for more KR in the final part of the acquisition phase, and a possible interaction of both results with the complexity of the task. The Anova revealed statistical differences between the tasks (complexity factor) in all phases of the experiment and between groups (schedule of KR factor) in the retention phase, with better results for the groups that asked for more KR in the final part of the acquisition phase when compared to the groups that asked for more KR in the initial part of the acquisition phase. No interactions or other statistical differences were found.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.6658439145756763,0.5298750733352784,0.40238988399505615,-0.28705719113349915,Computational,Not Computational

The 9(th) FINA World Swimming Championships of Water Polo for men and women 2001 was chosen for analysis. In total, there were 60 matches for men, and 48 matches for women, each match produced data for two teams and thus provided the potential for the analysis of 216 team performances. An original database program designed specifically for water polo match analysis was developed and data were input immediately whenever an event happened during a match. In order to obtain an overall picture of game performance for our study, we selected 21 items for offense and 11 items for defense. Principal component analysis and varimax rotation were used to determine the factorial structure of the game performance. Ten common factors were extracted, which accounted for 83% of the total variance in the 32 variables. The results of present study indicated two key areas that determine the outcome of a game. First, the ability to counterattack impacts on winning or losing. Top-ranked teams more often than not convert their chances to score when up an extraman. Low-ranked teams often fail to score when playing with superior numbers. Second, the ability to defend when down a player impacts substantially on the outcome. The better teams are more successful in producing a blocked or saved shot.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.5898966848532845,0.5849674730613655,0.17892977595329285,-0.18460851907730105,Computational,Not Computational

Structural changes included reducing the maximum bet size, reducing reel spin and removing large note acceptors. Behavioural patterns of play were observed in 779 participants attending clubs and hotels. Observations were conducted in the gaming venue during regular gaming sessions. Eight experimental machines were designed to represent every combination of the modifications. 210 participants played at least one modified and one unmodified machine. Following play, the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) was administered. More problem than non-problem gamblers used high denomination bill acceptors and bet over one-dollar per wager. Machines modified to accept the onedollar maximum bet were played for less time and were associated with smaller losses, fewer individual wagers and lower levels of alcohol consumption and smoking. It was concluded that the reduction of maximum bet levels was the only modification likely to be effective as a harm minimization strategy for problem gamblers.","Psychology, Multidisciplinary,Psychology",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,1,0.5073703776328696,0.6489344577206408,-0.034671582281589515,-0.0641552284359932,Computational,Computational

The introduction addresses research on social interaction, principles of dynamic systems, and of simulation. We proceed with a discussion of our interaction model, which is inspired by the theory of Frijda ( 1986). The model describes the continuous interaction between concerns, drives, emotional appraisals, emotional expressions and behaviour of children during each moment of the children's play session. The empirical validation of the model focuses on group differences ( averages and distributions of three types of dyads), which are based on a time-sampling of videotaped play interactions. The predictions of the model, which differ from those made on the basis of the current literature, are corroborated by our empirical data. The conclusion discusses the use of models in the explanation of social behaviour and development.","Psychology, Developmental,Psychology",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,1,0.2595374258396707,0.8690357355038181,-0.5047687888145447,0.5436053872108461,Computational,Computational

Given these constraints, why are infants so socially competent and how are they capable of processing such complex social information? Here we present an information-processing hypothesis that may account for these early social capacities. We outline those aspects of the social situation that must be processed for the infant to respond in a socially appropriate manner. We also outline potential cognitive sequences through which this information is processed. We conclude that the infant uses social information to determine what is relevant in the environment and in doing so, the infant uses each successive aspect of the social world to filter the overall amount of available information to a manageable size.","Psychology, Developmental,Psychology",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,1,0.06834052633497023,0.9815799481586442,-1.3199931383132937,1.2924712896347046,Computational,Computational

A desktop virtual environment was used in which participants moved in a controlled self-determined way. The regularity of environmental structure did not influence spatial knowledge as measured by direction estimations and distances walked in route knowledge and detour tasks. In all measurements, an overall developmental increase of achievement from second graders to adults was found. Furthermore, gender differences were found for children as well as for adults, favouring males in all measurements. In addition, orientation specificity of spatial representations was found for adults and for children.

Expert (N=9) and intermediate penalty kickers (N=9) performed a pre-treatment test consisting of 24 kicks in an actual play situation with expert (N=3) and intermediate goalkeepers (N=3). Both groups of kickers then completed 10 training sessions with the automatic system (no goalkeepers involved), and then repeated the initial test in the post-treatment evaluation. As variables we measured efficacy as the number of goals obtained, and whether the direction of the kick was the same as or different from the direction of the goalkeeper's move (DDG). Pretreatment results were homogeneous in both groups, but only expert kickers scored significantly more goals in the post-treatment evaluation. Differences in tactical skills were manifested as changes in DDG in the expert group. The results Suggest that penalty kicking in soccer can be viewed as an open motor skill dependent on the goalkeeper's actions.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.9988650955396524,0.03188582437656836,3.3657472133636475,-3.4143240451812744,Not Computational,Not Computational

Only 27.9% of match time was spent moving in a forward direction with players also performing movement in backwards, sideways, diagonal and arced directions. There were significant associations between direction of movement and movement type as well as between turning and movement type. Significant differences were found between the different positions for the distribution of match time among movements and the profile of directions travelled. Players performed the equivalent of 2.1 +/- 1.7 hops, 39.6+/-7.0 jumps, 7.4+/-7.1 leaps, 7.5+/-7.1 lunges and 7.7 +/- 3.8 braking movements during a 15 minute quarter.
